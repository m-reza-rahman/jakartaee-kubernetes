# Effective Kubernetes for Jakarta EE and MicroProfile Developers

There are several key techniques to understand while using Kubernetes with Java EE, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications. Examples include:

* How Kubernetes primitives (such as deployments and services) align with application server administration, clustering, auto-scaling, auto-discovery, and load-balancing.
* How to add self-healing capabilities using Kubernetes probes and monitoring with open source tools like Prometheus/Grafana.
* How Kubernetes can be extended using Operators to effectively manage application server clusters.
* How the CI/CD pipeline of your application can be adapted to Kubernetes.

This code and demo-driven workshop walks through each of these considerations in turn.
